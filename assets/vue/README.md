# Frontend-test Todo list

## Instructions
You will be asked to improve the code of this app with the following tasks.

[Github link](https://github.com/asknicely/frontend-test)

## Tasks
- [x] TASK 1: As a user I can mark a todo as completed.
- [x] TASK 2: Using JQuery, Vue.js, or React render the todo list dynamically and allow the delete and completed buttons to work via Ajax
We care about the user experience here, this might be animation?

## Extra tasks:

- [x] Fix any bugs you may find.
- [x] Fix any security issues you may find.
- [x] Adding a few unit tests to show us that you understand how they work is a bonus.

## Updates

- [x] Toggle todo completed state
- [x] Render both 'todo.html' and 'todos.html' together dynamically using VueJS, rather than linking from one page to another using a hyperlink. The idea is to speed up the response time and increase app performance and speed. I am aware the brief did not mention anything about the Todo page, so I want to confirm with you first before proceeding. 

## Available Scripts


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner using jest in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run format`

Parses and re-prints your code to enforce a consistent style.
